This is a modification to the Hysteria minecraft shader to add an option for translucent entities. While most of the time, this is perfectly fine, for Timeless and Classics: Zero (TACZ) there is an out of memory crash error due to some bug in TACZ itself.

# Installation
- Download zip. Top right "Code" -> "Download Zip"
- Put zip in minecraft's shaderpack folder
- Switch to the modified version in game
- Go to shader settings for the modified Hysteria shader
- Go to "Advanced Options" -> "Misc"
- Click "TRANSLUCENT_ENTITIES" so that it says "Off"
- Click done.
- Should hopefully work! Log into your game and use TACZ guns.

This seems to make so that bullet holes don't appear, but otherwise guns seem to work fine.
